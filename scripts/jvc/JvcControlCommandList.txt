JvcControl v1.3.

For NZ series, these are now password protected. Create a file JvcControlPassword.txt in the same directory with JvcControl.exe and put the password into this file (no carriage return).

Usage:
Run from command line passing the 2 digit command to execute. 
JvcControl {Command}

Example: to switch to USER1:
JvcControl 6C

Just run JvcControl by itself and it will scan the network for projector IP address.
Projector IP stored in file JvcControlIp.txt for faster access next time.

------------
Other commands:
Adding sleep xx to the end of your command line will cause the command to 
be delayed by xx seconds before running. Remember JVC Control is a windows
program so it will return control to a cmd / bat script right away. To avoid 
that you can use start /w command ie: start /w jvccontrol.exe 2E sleep 10
------------
Added "Lens" ie: jvccontrol Lens1  or jvccontrol Lens2 
to instantly switch to the appropriate lens mode without displaying UI

------------
Added InpL to change the input level
jvccontrol InpL1 will set HDMI enhanced. 
jvccontrol Inpl0 will set HDMI standard.
 0 = standard, 1 = enhanced, 2 = Super White, 3 = auto (default)

------------
Added Raw: and RawRead: to send any documented raw command out of the
IP / RS232 control manual. The read is useful for reading states.
If your command is using RawRead:, then the returned status from the projector will
be written to JvcReturnValue.txt in the jvccontrol.exe folder.

Here is an example that sets brightness to -1
c:\htpc\JvcControl.exe Raw:PMBRFFFE

This sets brightness to 0
c:\htpc\JvcControl.exe Raw:PMBR0000


Here is another exmaple that reads current gamma setting from projector and stores in JvcReturnValue.txt
c:\htpc\JvcControl.exe RawRead:PMGC
Then set gamma to 1.9
c:\htpc\JvcControl.exe Raw:PMGC06

Then restore gamma after movie ends:
set /p gamma=<JvcReturnValue.txt
c:\htpc\JvcControl.exe Raw:%gamma%

------------
Added ability to store and restore picture modes. This is useful if you want to change
picture mode at start of a movie and return at end of a movie automatically.
jvccontrol StorePictureMode yourfile.txt
This will write the current picture mode to a file in the jvccontrol folder called yourfile.txt

You can restore the picture setting from this file:
jvccontrol RestorePictureMode yourfile.txt

------------
Added On to simply and easily turn the projector on:
jvccontrol On

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup:
Connect your projector to the network and run JvcControl.exe alone. It should
find the projector's IP address. If not, you can debug your network.
If you're sure your projector is on the network but jvccontrol is not finding it
you can create a file called JvcControlIp.txt and put your IP address inside it
and JvcControl will use that, assuming it works. If it doesn't work, the file
may be deleted or changed.

For help connecting your projector to your network see the manual. But
it's advised to set the projector to a static IP address or assign it a
static IP in the router's DHCP routing table.  Verify connection to the
projector in command prompt using "ping" command. If you cannot ping
the projector, then you cannot communicate with it. 
ping 192.168.1.10 <-- for example.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no error checking. If you don't specify command, nothing will happen. 
If you specify garbage for a command, garbage gets sent to the projector and 
who knows what happens.

The command list is for the RS1000/N5, RS2000/N7, RS3000/NX9 but JVC hasn't switch 
command codes in ages only adds them. So if your projector supports the function, 
the code should work.
